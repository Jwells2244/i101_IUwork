#5 Different calculations:


x = 5
y = 7
z = 2

print(x+y+z)
print(5+7+2)
print(x+7)
print(x**z)
print(y/z) #Float
print(x % z) #Modulus
print(x+y/z) #Float
print(z/y) #Float


#Combining 5 different Strings together

s1 = "Hello"
s2 = ", how's it "
s3 = "going? "
s4 = "I hope it's going "
s5 = "well. "

#Converting a string to an integer, then doing a calculation, then displaying it as a string

print("This result is " + str(numString))
print("Another result is " + str(int(numString) + 2))


#I have a little bit of prior python experience.
