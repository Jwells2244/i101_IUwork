    <h2> <b>Introduction</b> </h2>
    <p style="width: 400px; font-size:20px;">My name is Jonathan Wells and welcome to my homepage! I am a student
      at Indiana University in Bloomington. This is a webpage for my <i>Informatics 101</i> class. This webpage
      contains some pictures of me, some examples of work that I have done for school, as well as some general
      knowledge about me. I hope you enjoy your time on this page, and learn a little bit about me in the process!

          <p style="width: 500px; font-size: 20px;"> My name is Jonathan Wells. I am a freshman currently majoring in Informatics, but
            I'm supposed to be majoring in computer science, so maybe this class will change
            my mind and keep me as an informatics major. I grew up in Bloomington, Illinois, so
            I've gone from Bloomington to Bloomington to come to Indiana University. In high
            school I played golf for 4 years, and soccer for my senior year, because Covid
            moved it to spring, and since golf was fall, and soccer was spring, I was able to
            play them both in the same year. I decided to attend Indiana University because I
            had heard good things about the Luddy School. My goals in the future include working for a company in
            a computer science field. I am always motivated by seeing the technology around me every day continue
            to improve and that inspires me to try to do the same.

    <h2 class="moveup"> <b>My Work</b> </h2>
    <p class="moveup" style="width: 400px; font-size:20px;">Here is where I want to show off some of the work I have done for school so far.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="moveup" style="width: 400px; font-size:20px;">My first project is for Informatics, where I photoshopped some social media posts
      into posts about a great female Computer Scientist Frances Allen, and then had to write a little bit about her and those posts.
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UvZfS8aBBzL_PzvuxKudoc87AO1M51qGsUN2zh0H934/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the link to the document</a>

    <p class="projectFormat" style="width: 400px; font-size:20px;">My second project is also for Informatics, where I wrote a small essay about two women in
      computer science, Frances Allen and Sophie Wilson, trying to highlight their contributions to the computer science field, and trying to pick one to do
      a project on.
