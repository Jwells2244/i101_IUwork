      Question 1: the len() function takes a parameter inside the parenthesis
      and tells you the number of items in the parameter that it is given.
    <p/>
    <p>
      Question 2: Informatics[3] equals "o"
    </p>
    <p>
      Question 3: I have to be honest, I am currently taking a python class so none of these
      topics are too difficult, but when I first started learning python the indexes confused
      me a little bit, with the first being zero and stuff like that, as well as when doing loops
      remembering that length starts at 1, and the indexes start at zero.
