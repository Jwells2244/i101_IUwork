      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>
        My name is <b>Jonathan Wells</b>. I am a freshman currently majoring in Informatics, but
        I'm supposed to be majoring in computer science, so maybe this class will change
        my mind and keep me as an informatics major. I grew up in Bloomington, Illinois, so
        I've gone from Bloomington to Bloomington to come to Indiana University. In high
        school I played golf for 4 years, and soccer for my senior year, because Covid
        moved it to spring, and since golf was fall, and soccer was spring, I was able to
        play them both in the same year. I decided to attend Indiana University because I
        had heard good things about the <b>Luddy</b> School. I decided to go into computer science
        because I took some computer science classes in high school and enjoyed them, and
        so far I am not regretting my decision.

      <h2> About This Webpage </h2>
      <p>
        This website is a homepage for my <i>Informatics-101</i> Lab. This website is hosted
        on pages through Indiana University. This homepage will act as a hub, allowing
        access to any webpages that I create for this class. This homepage will hopefully
        become better to look at throughout the year as I get better at html, as
        it's kind of an eyesore right now.

      <h2> My College Bucket List </h2>
      <p>
        I would say that there is not just one thing on the top of my college bucket list
        as there's so much stuff to do. I'm hoping to go to as many athletic events as
        possible, with IU football, soccer, and basketball being the main three that I
        hope I can go to. I'm hoping to study abroad during my time here, as my brother
        went to <i>Barcelona</i> and he loved the whole experience. I have heard a lot about how
        Indiana University has a great study abroad program so I'll definitely be looking
        to take advantage of that. I also hope I can just broaden my horizons with different
        activities and groups as much as I can while I'm here. I'm open to trying anything
        on campus, and I hope I can make a lot of great memories here at Indiana University.
