      A <b>Function</b> is a type of procedure or routine that carries out a task.
      These can either be user-defined or pre-defined/built-into Python
      An <b>Argument</b> is a value that is passed to a function, such as print(Argument)
      A <b>Variable</b> is a sort of container, that can be assigned a value and holds
      that value until it is changed, and this value can be used by calling the variable name
      A <b>Data Type</b> is a type that data in python has, such as 56 is an int, or "hi" is a string
      or x is a variable, or ["h","e","l","l","o"] is a list.


      The three data types that we have learned so far are:
        <b>String</b>, This is basically the data type for any form of text in quotation marks
        <b>Integer</b>, This is any number value that doesn't have a decimal point, no quotation marks needed
        <b>Float</b>, This is what's called a floating-point integer, which is an integer with a decimal point

      It is important to keep track of data types because python cannot handle all data types being operated on,
      such as an int cannot be concatenated with a string, without being typecasted as a str()
