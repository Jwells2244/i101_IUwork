        My name is Jonathan Wells, I am from Bloomington Illinois. I have grown
        up with technology, and I have taken some computer science courses in
        high school and have since decided to major in computer science. I took
        this class because it seemed like a good computer science class to take
        to further my studies.

        My expectations for this informatics class is to understand a field of
        computer science that I have no experience in, informatics I hope I can
        learn new skills that will help my future career in computer science.
